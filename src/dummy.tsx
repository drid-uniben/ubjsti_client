    abstract:
      "Heavy metals are often present in leachate at concentrations exceeding discharge limits. They are persistent, non-biodegradable and harmful to human health. It is important that leachate is effectively treated before discharge into aqueous systems. Isothermal and kinetic studies were undertaken to evaluate the removal of Pb, Ni, Cr and Zn ions from synthetic leachate by a cassava peel-derived adsorbent (CPDA). Batch experiments were conducted at varied initial conentrations (23-150mg/l) and contact times(10-60 minutes) and the data were analysed using the non-linear Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and the pseudo-first and second order kinetic models. The Freundlich isotherm provided a better description of the equilibrium process for all the metals. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacities were 50.95, 47.78, 44.72 and 22.26mg/g for Pb, Zn, Ni and Cr respectively. The pseudo-first order kinetic model provided a better fit for Pb and Cr, while Ni and Zn followed the pseudo-second order model. The results of this study have provided insight into the adsorption mechanisms and demonstrated the heavy metal removal capability of the adsorbent, while forming the basis for application to real leachate samples.",

    abstract:
      "Fresh samples of edible mushrooms - Volvariella volvacea, Pleurotus tuberregium and Pleurotus djamor – were collected from some home gardens in which the mushrooms were cultivated on decayed wood shavings from sawmills in Oluku, Benin-City, Edo state. These were harvested weighed and oven dried. The dried samples were milled and examined by chemical analyses for their proximate, minerals and phytochemical compositions. The results indicated appreciable amounts of essential nutrients in the mushroom species. Pleurotus tuberregium was the richest in protein content (41.32%) and highest moisture content (22.23%). P. djamar was rich in fat (15.63%), calcium (38.50mg/g), sodium (3.03mg/g) and magnesium (18.98mg/g). V. volvacea contained the highest value of ash content (14.05%) and carbohydrate (19.65%), while P. tuberregium was rich in crude fibre (6.75%) and potassium (7.25mg/g). The study confirmed that mushrooms have a higher levels of proteins than most leguminous plants and vegetables hence, could serve as substitutes for food legumes, meat or fish in food recipes. Phytochemical studies confirmed the presence of saponins, flavonoids, tannin, phenolic compounds and alkaloids in Volvariella volvacea, Pleurotus tuberregium and Pleurotus djamor. The charsterization of these phytocompounds in the mushrooms is recommended. show that they should be added in our daily meal due to their health benefits.",

    abstract:
      "Different brands of palm oil produced in parts of Edo and Delta states were classified as native (locally processed) or regular (industrially produced) and evaluated for their physical and chemical properties. Physical characteristics examined included oil color which varied between pale red and brick red, and specific gravity (SG) which ranged between 0.5 - 0.6. Olein-stearin ratio and the rate of spread of oil were variable. The free fatty acids in the different oil samples recorded 12.44 - 15.15mg/KOH/g. The saponification values varied between 202.0 mg/KOH/g and 210.8 mg/KOH/g while the iodine values were non-significantly (p>0.05) different between 49.07 - 50.93 Wij’s. The variation in peroxide values were significant, ranged from 6.0 to 14.67meq/g. Variance analysis also showed some non-significant (p>0.05) as well as significant differences (p<0.05) in various chemical properties of the different native and regular palm oils from Edo-Delta. The variation in properties and quality indices indicated lack of standardization of process in Palm oil milling in Nigeria. Quality assurance through the introduction of modular design and process for small and medium scale palm oil mills is recommended.",

    title: "FORMS AND DISTRIBUTION PATTERN OF IRON OXIDE IN SOILS FORMED UNDER FOUR DIFFERENT PARENT MATERIALS IN SOUTHERN WESTERN NIGERIA.",
    abstract:
      "This study investigated the forms and distribution of Iron (Fe) oxide in soils developed from four different parent materials in Nigeria, and their relationship with some soil physical and chemical properties. Composite soil samples were collected at soil depths of 0–30cm, 30–60cm, 60–90cm and 90–120cm from Idanre (Basement complex) in Ondo State. Koko (Alluvium) in Delta State, Nigeria Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR) (Coastal Plain Sands) and Uhonmora (Shale) both in Edo State, Nigeria. The soils were analyzed for the physical and chemical properties, using standard laboratory techniques. The concentrations and forms of Fe were extracted using the total Ammonium Oxalate Extract (Amorphous forms), Citrate – Bicarbonate Dithionite Extract (Crystalline forms) and the Pyrophosphate solution (Amorphous organic forms). Data obtained were subjected to statistical analysis and the mean separation was carried out using the Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT). Results showed that the concentrations of iron oxides in the soils were higher than those of aluminum and manganese in all the locations. The crystalline free oxides dominated the soils in Shale, Hydromorphic, Coastal plain sand and Basement Complex. They had mean concentrations ranging from 1.46–5.71mgkg-1 (mean of 3.40mgkg-1). The Amorphous forms of Fe oxides were generally lower than other oxides in the four locations. The lowest mean concentration for all the oxide forms were found in Coastal plain sand compared to shale which had the highest concentration. Correlation studies showed that there was a positive and significant (p>0.5) correlation between clay and other parameters, suggesting that the oxide concentration increased with the prevalence of clay in all the location studied.",

    title: "REMOVAL OF HEAVY METALS FROM DUMPSITE LEACHATE USING CASSAVA PEEL-DERIVED ADSORBENT",
    abstract:
      "Dumpsite leachate contains harmful pollutants including heavy metals which are detrimental to humans and the environment. Conventional metal removal methods are expensive and may result in the production of large volumes of sludge, hence the focus on natural low-cost adsorbents. In this study, the use of an adsorbent derived from cassava peels for the removal of nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr) and zinc (Zn) from dumpsite leachate was investigated. Leachate samples were obtained from a dumpsite and characterized to determine the concentration of heavy metals. Batch experiments were conducted to assess the effect of adsorbent dose, pH, temperature and agitation speed on the removal of heavy metals from the leachate.  The leachate samples analyzed had 8.43mg/l and 1.09 mg/l of zinc and lead respectively, which exceeded the relevant surface water discharge limits. The optimum operational parameters were determined as follows: adsorbent dose (0.3g), pH (4), temperature (35˚C) and agitation speed (150rpm). Overall, the highest removal efficiencies achieved were 66, 83, 63 and 77% for Ni, Pb, Cr and Zn respectively. The results indicate that cassava peel-derived adsorbent can potentially be utilized in the removal of heavy metal pollutants from dumpsite leachate before disposal.",

      "This research was designed to determine the phytochemical composition, acute toxicity, as well as anti-depressant effect of the ethyl acetate root extract of Rauvolfia vomitoria. The phytochemical analysis of Rauvolfia vomitoria was determined using standard methods, while FST (forced swim test) and TST (tail suspension test) were applied to evaluate the anti-depressant activity. The result indicated that the ethyl acetate root extract of Rauvolfia vomitoria is rich in tannins, phenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, glycosides and alkaloids. The oral administration of ethyl acetate root extract of Rauvolfia vomitoria to Swiss mice shows no mortality at maximum dose of 100 mg/kg after 14 days. Immobility was observed during the 5-minute interval after administering doses of 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg of the root extract respectively to Swiss mice. It was observed that Rauvolfia vomitoria has anti-depressant effect at low dose of 25 mg/kg. It has potential detrimental properties when used in high doses. Therefore, the plant should be taken with caution when used for therapeutic purposes.",

    abstract:
      "Nursing students' satisfaction with clinical experiences is one important criterion for evaluating clinical practice in nursing education. This study assessed the level of satisfaction with clinical experiences among undergraduate nursing students in tertiary institutions in Ovia North East Local Government Area, Edo state. A descriptive cross-sectional research design was adopted for the study. A total of three hundred and eighty (380) participants took part using convenient sampling and a self-structured questionnaire as instrument for data collection. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and hypotheses were tested using Independent T-test at 5% level of significance. All analyses were done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Gender of respondents show that majority 117 (31%) were males while the remaining 263 (69%) were females. Age of respondents shows that 90 (24%) were less than 20 years, 160(42%) were within the age range of 20-25 years, 119(31%) were within the age group of 26-30 years, 11(3%) were above 30 years. Most respondents 197(58.1%) had poor satisfaction with their clinical experience. Generally, attitude towards clinical posting/exposure were positive (2.38±1.12). Clinical environment factor (2.64±1.03) and preceptor factor (2.60±1.11) were found to affect the level of satisfaction with clinical experiences. This study established poor satisfaction with clinical experience among undergraduate nursing students. Clinical environment and preceptor factors were found to affect level of satisfaction. Improved clinical environment with experienced clinical instructors/preceptors should be adequately in place as they have a great impact on clinical experience.",

    abstract:
      "This study investigated the profile of testicular (gonad) and epididymal (extragonadal) sperm characteristics and spermiogram in Epomops franqueti bat caught during the peak (late wet season) of reproductive activities. Fifteen adult male African fruit bats (E. franqueti) trapped using Mist net at University of Ibadan, Nigeria (07° 26ˊN 03° 54ˊ E) were used for this experiment. Bats were anaesthetized using ketamine HCl (25mg̸kg), incised via ventral abdomen to exteriorize testes and epididymides needed for the evaluations of sperm morphology, motility, concentration, livability ratio and morphometry. Morphologically, the spermatozoa head of E. franqueti under the light microscope were oval with the apex of the sperm head being conical. The entire length of the spermatozoa measured approximately 58.11 ± 1.84 µm. Generally, the head measured 8.97± 0.38µm in length and 5.91 ± 0.34 µm in diameter which varied significantly (P˂ 0.05). The relationship between the entire sperm length and the head length (r=0.566), the mid piece (r=0.283) and the tail (r=0.886) showed positive correlation. The epididymal sperm motility, livability and concentration were markedly increased compared to the testicular parameters. Also, both testicular and epididymal sperm abnormalities were strikingly lower than the range reported for most mammals. The set of data evaluated in this study provided the basis for the elaborate breeding potential of this bat species.",

      "African fruit bat, Epomops franqueti is a megachiroptera of the family pteropodidae and phytophagous. This preliminary work aimed at elucidating the bat brain machineries involved in foraging for food, its adaptation and survival. The gross anatomy and morphometrics of the head and brain were investigated to establish the echolocation capability, visual sensibility, and the olfaction acuity by measuring the whole brain weights, length, and diameter. Ten adult male African fruit bats were used for this work and their average body and head weights were 72.35±10.36g and 14.76±1.53g respectively, while the brain weight was 1.89 ±0.07g. Our findings revealed that the brain of E. franqueti was small brain with relative weight of 2.57%. The relative weight of the head was 20.39%. The mean length of the brain was 28.7 ± 0.10 mm, the olfactory lobe had a mean length of 3.5 ± 0.10 mm, while the cranial and caudal colliculi had average diameter of 3.6 ± 0.02 mm and 1.2 ± 0.02 mm, respectively, with strong indication that the bat depends more on the visual senses with a well-developed optic nerve, for its phytophagous nature.",

      "This study investigates the effect of treated refinery effluent on some selected soil properties. The experiment involved the use of four different rates of refinery effluent 0, 50, 100, and 150 ml / 2 kg soil in twelve pots laid out in a Completely Randomized Design at a screen house. The soil samples were analyzed for physical, chemical, and microbial properties before and after the experiment, and changes in soil microbial properties were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics. Results showed that the soil physical properties (textually) remained unchanged but the exchangeable acidity (0.11 – 0.98 cmolkg-1), ECEC (2.5 – 4.1 cmolkg-1), exchangeable bases and O.C (0.17 – 0.94%) , Cr (0.27 – 0.95 mgkg-1), Cd (2.4 – 3.6 mgkg-1) and Ni (0.8 – 4.1mgkg-1) contents of the treated soils were greatly enhanced with increase in the rate of treated refinery effluent applied and the quantity of the  heavy metals were far above the permissible limit (0.3 mgkg-1). The predominant bacteria species in the soil were Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus while Micrococcus was present only in the uncontaminated soil and Corynebacteria were found in soils with higher rates (T150 and T100) of effluent. The fungal species were Penicillum notatum, Trichoderma, Yeast, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus. The results from the study implied that, treated refinery effluent has the capacity of altering the microbial composition of soils.",

    title: "HAEMATOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO DIETARY ASCORBIC ACID AND BETAINE FED TO FEMALE JAPANESE QUAILS DURING THE DRY SEASON",
    abstract:
      "Environmental conditions prevailing in the dry season may induce heat stress, which may be evaluated by haematological values in Japanese quails. The present study investigated the haematological responses to dietary ascorbic acid and betaine fed to female Japanese quails during the dry season. A total of 468 female Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) at 14 days old weighing 26-28 grams were used for the study. The quails were allotted into four groups namely the control, fed basal diets only, those fed ascorbic acid, AA-group; betaine, BET-group and combination of ascorbic acid and betaine – AA+BET group. Some microclimatic variables were measured daily at 08:00 h, 13:00 h and 17:00 h for 42 days. The variables include dry-bulb temperature (DBT – in ºC), relative humidity (RH) and temperature-humidity index (THI). Blood samples were collected from each of the six birds randomly selected from each group (two per replicate) in sample bottles with and without anticoagulants (EDTA) at 28, 49 and 70 days old. Serum malondialdehyde concentrations (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione peroxidase (rGSH), as well as the haematology of the birds, were evaluated. Results indicate that, whereas AA and/or betaine decreased MDA, they increased SOD and rGH activities. Betaine increased the RBC count but reduced MCV and MCH. Ascorbic acid, supplemented either alone or with betaine, reduced total leukocyte count and the number of basophils, monocytes, eosinophils and H/L ratio. It is concluded that dietary ascorbic acid and betaine modulated the haematological profile of female Japanese quails reared during the dry season.",

    title: "LAND CAPABILITY CLASSIFICATION OF UNIVERSITY OF BENIN EXPERIMENTAL FARM",
    abstract:
      "Land users in most parts of the world are yet to come to terms with the fact that land capability assessment provides a ranking of the ability of an area to support a range of agricultural activities on a sustainable basis. The choice of landuse options have been based on mere discretion or local experience rather than good understanding of the physical characteristics of land, its inherent qualities and farm management practices that will support maximization of  profits in agricultural investments in recent times. This study was conducted in University of Benin experimental farm to determine the capability of the land for crop production. The methodology involved a rigid grid soil survey at an intensive scale which produced two (2) modal classes; each modal class was represented by a pedon that was described, sampled and analysed appropriately using standard procedures. Results obtained from routine analysis revealed that sand was the dormant fraction of particle size (735 – 875 gkg-1); silt ranged from 10 - 55 gkg-1, clay values ranged from 70 – 286 gkg-1; pH ranged from extremely acidic to strongly acidic, (4.1-5.2), organic carbon was low (2.0 – 9.80 gkg-1). Exchangeable bases (Ca 0.69 – 0.86 cmolkg-1; Mg 0.12 – 0.18 cmolkg-1; Na 0.08 – 0.12 cmolkg-1; K 0.16 – 0.21) were generally low when compared to their critical values. Land capability classification revealed that the study area qualified as class IV. The major constraint to crop production in the area is fertility (ECEC and Base Saturation) which is evident in the low pH values of the soils. Therefore, only arable crops can be grown in the study area. However, amendment with the right types and quantities of fertilizers as well as improved management practices would improve the capability status of the land.",
